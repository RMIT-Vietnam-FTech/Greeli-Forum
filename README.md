# Fullstack-Node-Web-Project-COSC3060
This is a template for a fullstack Node Web Project for COSC3060!

**Using git and github rules:**
- Use development branch for developing website's functions
- From "origin/development" branch, create new branch to create and test new function with this name convention:
  - UI: ui/nameofui -> ui/homepage
  - Function (on server): function/nameoffunction â†’ e.g: function/comment
  - Fullstack: full/ui+function
- When finish developing the function, commit changes and create a pull request to the development branch.

**Working on code:**
  - on client, run "npm start" to start the client-side
  - on server, run "npm run dev" to start the server-side
  - any parameters used to configue on the server should be put in ".env"
  - When finish working on the function, use "npm run check" to run the biome check and fix if there are any errors before commit code and create a pull request
